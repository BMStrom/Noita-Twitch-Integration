## Installation
* Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) **don't install build tools when asked on the node installer**

* [Download](https://github.com/soler91/Noita-Twitch-Integration/archive/master.zip) this repository and unzip the folder **inside noita's mods folder** and rename it to **twitch-integration**

* Open `install.bat` and wait for it to finish

* Open `start_twitch.bat` and it will open a browser window with the control panel, head to the Twitch tab and write your twitch channel name, scroll down and click apply

* It will require you to restart the bot after making changes to the twitch channel name so close the command prompt and open ``start_twitch.bat`` once again

* Go to your mods menu and enable Twitch-helper

* New game and scroll down for the twitch integration gamemode

* [Optional] make a shortcut of start_twitch.bat and put it on your desktop for ease of access
