# Noita-Twitch-Integration

## Installation
* Download noita-ws-api and unzip the folders `TwitchIntegration` and `mod_ws_api` into your noita Mods folder
[Download here](https://github.com/soler91/noita-ws-api/archive/master.zip)

* Grab the [pollws binaries](https://github.com/probable-basilisk/pollws/releases/download/0.1.0/pollws_0_1_0_windows.zip): copy
the `pollws.dll` from the **win32** folder into your Noita install dir **(so it should be in the same directory as `Noita.exe`).**

* Enable the `TwitchIntegration` and `mod_ws_api` mods in the Noita mods menu. It will ask for full permissions (in order to use the FFI); presumably
you understand what that means and the risks involved.

* Clone or [Download](https://github.com/soler91/Noita-Twitch-Integration/archive/master.zip) this repository and unzip the folder anywhere

* Open `install.bat` and wait for it to finish

* Open `start_twitch.bat` and it will open a browser window with the control panel, head to the Twitch tab and write your twitch channel name, scroll down and click apply

* It will require you to restart the bot after making changes to the twitch channel name so close the command prompt and open ``start_twitch.bat`` once again
